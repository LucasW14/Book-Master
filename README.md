## Description 
> Book Master is a website used to match users to the type of book they need. Based off charactersitics of the user whether they are a student, parent, or someone who loves to read they are matched to books that fit that specific category. Providers that are willing to sell their books will put a description of the book along with the categories that define the book.Then the book will be matched to a customer looking for a book in the same categories. This app aims to reduce the amount of aimless wandering for people who don't know what to read by analyzing who they are and finding the right book for them.
